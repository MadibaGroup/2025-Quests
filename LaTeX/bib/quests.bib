	abstract = {While email is the most ubiquitous and interoperable form of online communication today, it was not conceived with strong security guarantees, and the ensuing security enhancements are, by contrast, lacking in both ubiquity and interoperability. This situation motivates our research. We begin by identifying a variety of stakeholders who have an interest in the current email system and in efforts to provide secure solutions. We then use the tussle among stakeholders to explain the evolution of fragmented secure email solutions undertaken by industry, academia, and independent developers, and to draw the conclusion that a one-size-fits-all solution is unlikely. We highlight that vulnerable users are not well served by current solutions. We also account for the failure of PGP, and argue secure messaging, while complementary, is not a fully substitutable technology.},

@inproceedings{Fogg09,
	abstract = {This paper presents a new model for understanding human behavior. In this model (FBM), behavior is a product of three factors: motivation, ability, and triggers, each of which has subcomponents. The FBM asserts that for a person to perform a target behavior, he or she must (1) be sufficiently motivated, (2) have the ability to perform the behavior, and (3) be triggered to perform the behavior. These three factors must occur at the same moment, else the behavior will not happen. The FBM is useful in analysis and design of persuasive technologies. The FBM also helps teams work together efficiently because this model gives people a shared way of thinking about behavior change.},

@inproceedings{FB19,
	abstract = {Efficient transfers to many recipients present a host of issues on Ethereum. First, accounts are identified by long and incompressible constants. Second, these constants have to be stored and communicated for each payment. Third, the standard interface for token transfers does not support lists of recipients, adding repeated communication to the overhead. Since Ethereum charges resource usage, even small optimizations translate to cost savings. Airdrops, a popular marketing tool used to boost coin uptake, present a relevant example for the value of optimizing bulk transfers. Therefore, we review technical solutions for airdrops of Ethereum-based tokens, discuss features and prerequisites, and compare the operational costs by simulating 35 scenarios. We find that cost savings of factor two are possible, but require specific provisions in the smart contract implementing the token system. Pull-based approaches, which use on-chain interaction with the recipients, promise moderate savings for the distributor while imposing a disproportional cost on each recipient. Total costs are broadly linear in the number of recipients independent of the technical approach. We publish the code of the simulation framework for reproducibility, to support future airdrop decisions, and to benchmark innovative bulk payment solutions.},
